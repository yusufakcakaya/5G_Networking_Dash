## Description

This processed data results from an analysis of the capacity, coverage and cost of different enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB) 5G infrastructure strategies for the Netherlands. The data represent both a supply-driven and demand-driven investment analysis. The supply-driven analysis estimates the capacity that can be provided to users via new spectrum, before network densification via small cells is required. The demand-driven analysis tests a range of required per user speeds including 30, 100 or 300 Mbps and quantifies the performance of strategies in meeting this demand.
